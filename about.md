My name is Alexander Leo, but Alex will do fine. This blog is mostly about Javascript, but I'll also cover content related to computer science and web applications. I currently reside in the Tampa Bay area of sunny Florida, with plans to re-locate to the not-so-tropical but equally lovable Boston, Massachusetts. I enjoy work on both front and back end systems. Computers are my biggest passion, especially building new ones. I love a good challenge and I am always looking for great resources to expand my skills! Outside of coding I enjoy video games, pop culture, streetwear, Japanese animation, tea, cars, and computer customization.
