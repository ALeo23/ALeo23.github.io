My name is Alexander Leo, but Alex will do fine. This blog is mostly about Javascript, but I'll also cover content related to computer science and web applications. I currently reside in the Tampa Bay area of sunny Florida. My coding experience began in 2016. With a dream and a passion, I set out to learn how to code. Soon after, I discovered Hack Reactor and joined their Remote Prep course. I am now a student at Hack Reactor and this blog will detail some of the adventures that got me there, as well as my personal insights on the student experience at Hack Reactor. Outside of coding I enjoy video games, pop culture, streetwear, Japanese animation, tea, cars, and computer customization.
